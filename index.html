			<h2>ABOUT:</h2>
			<div class= "bullets">

				<p>Hello! My name is Elle Bayless, and I am a full stack web development student with a background in the nonprofit sector.
					<br>
					<br>
					Before Galvanize, I loved working towards BBB’s mission to promote trust in the marketplace. However, I knew the time was right to pursue a career in tech when I started programming as a hobby and discovered that I have a passion for the unique fusion of logic and creativity that coding requires.
					<br>
					<br>
					I’ll be completing the Galvanize immersive on July 28, 2017. After I graduate, I plan to pursue work in the Phoenix area. You can find more about me on my github page, which is linked below. I’d love to hear your story and share more of mine with you, so please don’t hesitate to reach out!
					</p>
				<ul>
					<li>I'm from Fort Collins, Colorado but currently reside in Phoenix, Arizona.</li>
					<li>I love music, and have been playing viola for over a decade.</li>
					<li>My favorite video games are Super Meat Boy, Skyrim, Crash Bandicoot, Spyro, and Journey.</li>
					<li>
					I'm currently working with JavaScript, Express, Node.js, Angular, React, Vue.js, and HTML/CSS.
